# Simulation outputs

My project used the pure dark matter cosmological simulation run by Lucie-Smith et al. (2018) produced from GADGET codes (Springel, 2005).  
Outputs of the simulation were 101 snapshots correspond to the same simulation at different times.  
This github repository contains the final snapshot (snapshot_099) as well as its halo informations, placed in the folder "Simulation_Used".   
In order to run the codes (expect for "Time evolution") in the folder "Codes-ipynb", one needs to download the contents inside the folder "Simulation_Used" and place them in the same directory with the codes.    
Note that the notebook "Time evolution" requires snapshots_000, 009, 019, 029, 039, 049, 059, 069, 079 and 089 to run properly, which are not included in this github repository.
